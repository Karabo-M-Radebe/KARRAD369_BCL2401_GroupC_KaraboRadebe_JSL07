# Reflections 

### Areas of mastery 
I believe I have now mastered how to create, manipulate, and populate modals. This project exposed me to various skills that I encountered during my search for the solution and going forward, I was able to learn about modals and template strings and literals that were included in my project.  

### Challenges faced 
I did not encounter many challenges throughout the project, I was however struggling with displaying my modal contents and I was able to find the solution with the help of my peer and Google.  

### Areas of Improvement 
An area of improvement that I would like to focus on would be the innerHTML syntax along with the template literals. I believe focusing on them can greatly improve the type of projects I build as they are a great tool to have in your arsenal, especially regarding the aesthetics of my projects.  

## Overall learning experience
My overall experience was quite positive, I felt that the project taught me how to better interpret code and understand how the coding language used can be very useful and ultimately beneficial to beginners in the coding journey.
